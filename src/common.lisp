(defun decode-hash-table (hash-table)
  "Decodes a hash table representing a list response from the Stripe API.

The function extracts the :data and :has-more keys from the hash table and
returns two values:
1. A vector of objects corresponding to the items in the :data array.
2. The value of :has-more key, indicating if there are more items available.

For each item in the :data array, the function determines the object type based
on the :object key. It then finds the corresponding class symbol in the stripe
package and creates an instance of that class using the item hash table as the
:data initialization argument.

Special case handling by `normalize-object-type`:
If the object-type is like \"invoiceitem\" (ends with \"item\" but does not
contain an underscore),the function adds a hyphen before \"item\" to match the
naming convention for the corresponding class (e.g., \"invoiceitem\" becomes
\"invoice-item\"). However, if the object-type is like \"subscription_item\"
(contains an underscore before \"item\"), it is left unchanged.

If no matching class symbol is found, the item hash table is returned as is."
